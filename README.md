# The bulk JFIF and WEBP to PNG converter

This program grabs all `.jfif` and `.webp` files in any folder you want and converts them all to `.png` files. Any transparency is preserved, though. The file are always sorted by its "date".

## How to run this

1. Firstly, [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You should always install the latest version. This project was created for Python 3.10, but most other Python 3 versions should be compatible with it. This program won't run if you don't have Python installed.

2. Clone this repository by downloading it as a ZIP. Extract all the contents to **an empty folder.**

3. Run the `.bat` file by clicking on it. If you don't want to, you can use any other method that runs Python files.
